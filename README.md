# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
While working on this assignment I had face one issue which was Validating input,it is one of the most prevalent issues. It can be difficult to make sure the function gracefully accepts unexpected or invalid inputs.

-One more issue was not getting the output because of not reviewing the code and for me it is become more essential to double check every code and command.

## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
The first and foremst benefit would be unit tests give you assurance that your code functions as intended. When every test passes, you can have faith in your coding skill.

 Unit tests help in detecting issues in your code early in the development process, making it easier and cheaper to fix problems.
